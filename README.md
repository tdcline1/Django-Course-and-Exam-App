An `onlinecourse` app was provided in which I added a new assesement feature.
I implemented the following:
  Created Question, Choice, and Submission models
  Created a new course object with exam related models using the admin site
  Updated the course details template to show questions and choices
  Created a new exam result template to show the result of the submission
  Created a new exam result submission view
  Created a new view to display and evaluate exam result

To do
- Choose cloud platform for deployment (ie IBM Cloud Foundry)
- Depending on deployment, choose any SQL database Django supports such as SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and MySQL (default is SQLite3)
